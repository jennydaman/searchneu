                Thanks for your interest! We'd love to have more people help out with the project. We are looking for people for both introductory level roles and leadership roles. There's a lot of CS stuff (new features, etc) and non-CS stuff (posters, marketing, outreach, etc) that we could work on, so it is no problem at all if you don't have a lot of experience in CS! Everything is flexible, and we could help you learn some programming along the way if you want to work on the siteÂ ðŸ™‚. Leave your name and some way we can get in contact (Facebook URL, email, Fortnite username, etc) and someone will reach out!

                  Thanks for your interest! We'd love to have more people help out with the project. We are looking for people for both introductory level roles and leadership roles. There's a lot of CS stuff (new features, etc) and non-CS stuff (posters, marketing, outreach, etc) that we could work on, so it is no problem at all if you don't have a lot of experience in CS! Everything is flexible, and we could help you learn some programming along the way if you want to work on the siteÂ ðŸ™‚. Leave your name and some way we can get in contact (Facebook URL, email, Fortnite username, etc) and someone will reach out!

Everything is flexible, and we could help you learn some programming along the way if you want to work on the siteÂ ðŸ™‚.

                  Thanks for your interest! We'd love to have more people help out with the project. We are looking for people for both introductory level roles and leadership roles. There's a lot of CS stuff (new features, etc) and non-CS stuff (posters, marketing, outreach, etc) that we could work on, so it is no problem at all if you don't have a lot of experience in CS! Everything is flexible, and we could help you learn some programming along the way if you want to work on the siteÂ ðŸ™‚. Leave your name and some way we can get in contact (Facebook URL, email, Fortnite username, etc) and someone will reach out!
